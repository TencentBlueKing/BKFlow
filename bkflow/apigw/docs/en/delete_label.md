### Tenant access constraints

When multi-tenancy is enabled, an all-tenant application must specify the request tenant through `X-Bk-Tenant-Id`. A single-tenant application may omit this header and use the authenticated application tenant in the JWT; any explicit header must match it. The request tenant must match the tenant of the resource's space. An all-tenant application must create separate spaces for each tenant. Existing application-to-space/template bindings still apply. If the JWT contains an authenticated user, that user's tenant must also match. Missing or mismatched tenant information causes the request to be rejected.

Application-authenticated endpoints do not require an additional user identity. SDK user-authenticated endpoints still require an authenticated user; platform administrators and space administrators cannot cross tenant boundaries. Disabling multi-tenancy preserves single-tenant behavior.

### Resource description

Delete a tag

### Common authentication parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| bk_app_code | string | Yes | Application ID (app ID), available in BlueKing Developer Center > Application settings > Basic information > Authentication information |
| bk_app_secret | string | Yes | Application secret (app secret), available in BlueKing Developer Center > Application settings > Basic information > Authentication information |

### Notes

- Deleting a root tag also deletes all its child tags.
- Before deletion, the task module is called to delete task-tag associations. If that call fails, deletion fails and returns the corresponding error.
